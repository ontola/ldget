A simple command line interface tool to get RDF items using HTTP GET requests.

[![asciicast](demo.gif)](https://asciinema.org/a/BOc4JjKkTbMOwA2IvnJ7V3uhp)

## When should you use this?

- You need RDF data as Stdout.
- Write bash scripts that use linked data.ldget
- Check triple values from inside your terminal.
- Testing your linked data service.
- Get data from your [Solid](https://github.com/solid/solid) pod.

## Installation

- On MacOS using [homebrew](https://brew.sh/): `$ brew tap ontola/ldget https://github.com/ontola/ldget.git && brew install ontola/ldget/ldget`
- Or install the binaries from the [releases page](https://github.com/ontola/ldget/releases)
- Or build it yourself. Install golang, clone this repo and run `go get ./... && go install` to install the dependencies and add `ldget` to `path`.

## Usage

```
COMMANDS:
   triples, t            Fetch an RDF resource, return the triples. Serialized as N-Triples.
   predicates, p         Fetch an RDF resource, return the predicates.
   objects, o            Fetch an RDF resource, return the objects.
   subjects, s           Fetch an RDF resource, return the subjects.
   predicateObjects, po  Fetch an RDF resource, return the predicate and object values.
   show, sh              Fetch an RDF resource, return the predicate and object values in a nice table.
   prefixes              Shows your user defined prefixes from  '~/.ldget/prefixes'.
   expand, x             Expands any prefix. `ldget x schema` => https://schema.org/
   help, h               Shows a list of commands or help for one command
```

Use `?s ?p ?o` to filter by `%{subject URL} %{predicate URL} %{object value}`. This is similar to [Triple Pattern Fragments](http://www.hydra-cg.com/spec/latest/triple-pattern-fragments/#bib-hydra-ldf).

If you want to fetch a URL, but do not want to filter by it's subject, you can use the `--resource` flag:

`ldget triples --resource http://example.com/myResourceURL` Returns all triples for that resource as N-Triples.

Use the `.` character as a wildcard. For example, if you want to get all triples for subject `http://example.com/X` with an object value of `"Value"`, use:

`$ ldget triples http://example.com/X . "Value"`

## Prefixes

URLs are awesome, but they are cumbersome to remember and type.
You can specify a set of prefixes in `~/.ldget/prefixes` for mapping URLs to shorthands.

```
schema=http://schema.org/
joep=https://argu.co/argu/u/joep
```

`$ ldget objects joep schema:description`

## Test

- `$ go test`
